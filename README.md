### About Me

**Hello! I'm Pranav Visavadia.**

Welcome to my portfolio! As a passionate and dedicated aspiring full-stack developer from India, I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). I hold a Bachelor of Computer Application degree and am currently pursuing a Master of Computer Application, fine-tuning my expertise to become a frontrunner in the tech industry.

#### My Journey:

- **Educational Background:** I embarked on my tech journey in 2020, acquiring a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Application and continuing my education with a Master's in the same field.
  
- **Professional Training:** To enhance my practical skills, I completed a Full Stack Development course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com), where I delved deep into front-end, back-end, and database management technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB.

#### Projects and Experience:

- **Diverse Portfolio:** My practical experiences range from developing dynamic web applications to creating responsive websites. Notable projects include:
  - A comprehensive **Blog Application** using the MERN stack, designed to support real-time interactions.
  - A clone of **StackOverflow**, also built using the MERN stack, showcasing my ability to handle complex full-stack application development.
  - Along with these, I've embarked on numerous smaller ventures that exhibit my versatility and creativity, which are visible on my [projects page](https://pranav1326.github.io/pranav-portfolio/projects).
